- Historical perspectives

`^ I don't think it would be that important but will do later if time permits`

- Definition:
> `Software Quality Assurance`
> - SQA is a process which guarantees that all software engineering progressions, methods, activities and work items are examined and comply contradiction of the defined standards.
>
> `Software Quality`
> - Software Quality means how well the software is designed and how well the software conforms to that design.
>

- Core components of Quality:
> - Customer Satisfaction
> - Quality Parameters
>   - Define: Defining product requirements in terms of attributes.
>   - Measure: Measuring quality in quantitative terms.
>   - Monitor: Observing performance of processes used in development, testing, and delivery.
>   - Control: Must have functions like quality control, validation, verification, and quality assurance. Product progress must be reviewed and controlled through these functions.
>   - Improve: Continuous and continual improvement methods should be followed by the organization.
> - Efforts for improvement
> - Continual / Continuous Process Improvement

- Continuous and Continual Improvement difference:

> Continuous Improvement | Continual Improvement
> ---|---
> Continuous Improvement is dynamic in nature | Continual improvement is dynamic and static change in management
> The changes are done at every stage and everytime | The changes are done before taking next step of improvement
> It Continuously strive for excellence | It performs periodic improvement followed by stabilization process.

- Customer, Suppliers and processes:
> - For every organization, there always exists someone who supplies and someone who buys the resources, the one who provides are known as suppliers where the one who is being provided is known as the customer.
> - Suppliers and Customers both maybe inside or outside of the organization.

- Objectives of Testing:
> - The objectives of testing are to:
>   - check if there exists any defects in the software and prevent them.
>   - check if the software passes all the defined test cases it was designed for and validate them.
>   - check if the software meet defined requirements
>   - build confidence among stakeholders and developers that the product is build as it was designed.
>   - identify, analyze and reduce risk
>   - find chances of failure and technological durability of the product.

- Testing and Debugging:
> - Testing:
>   - The process of verifying and validating if the product is bug free and meet all the defined user as well as customer requirements is known as testing.
>
> - Debugging:
>   - The process of identifying, analyzing and removing errors that cause failure is known as debugging.
>   

- Need of testing:
> - There is a need for testing because testing helps us in:
>   - identification, analysis and removal of errors.
>   - checking if the software is adaptable to different test cases and scenarios.
>   - checking if there exists any risk
>   - checking if the project meet the requirement specified beforehand.
>   - making sure if the software is bug free and user friendly.


- Quality Assurance and Testing:
> - Quality Assurance:
>   - The process of making sure if the product is high quality and meets defined quality standards is known as quality assurance.
> - Testing:
>   - The process of verifying and validating the correctness of features and functionalities of the product is known as testing.

- Difference between quality assurance and testing:
> Quality Assurance | Testing
> --- | ---
> Process of making sure if the product meets specified quality requirements | Process of verifying and validating features and functionality for correctness
> It includes each step of software development | It is done at the end of development
> Ensure the quality by checking all the procedures and processes are in place | validate specifications against likely and unlikely inputs
> Focuses on processes to achieve quality | Focuses on actual testing of the final product to make sure if it's working properly
> It's process oriented | It's Product oriented
> It's preventive method | It's corrective method
> Assures quality | Controls quality

- Why software has errors, defects and failures?
> - Because of:
>   - Poor specification of requirements
>   - Complexity of feature required
>   - Logical falsies while writing the code.
>   - Programming errors.
>   - Use of Obsolete libraries and methodologies
>   - Lack of skilled developers.
>   - Badly written and poorly documented code.

- Relationship between errors, defects and failures:
> - An error cause defect which if not removed might cause failure.
> - Error ---(leads to)---> Defect ---(leads to)--->  Failure

- Causes of errors, defects and failure:
> - Developer was pressurized to complete the project within impossible time constraints and not given enough time to think and write efficient code.
> - Human mistakes leading to errors, defects and failure.
> - Inexperienced or insufficiently skilled developer or project contributor.
> - Miscommunication between project participants.
> - Feature way too complex to design and code.
> - Use of new or unfamiliar technological stack.
> - Improper environmental conditions.

- Effects of errors, defects and failures:
> - A lot of errors, defects and failures of software will cause technical debt and the project will not be able to met the specified deadline.
> - Fixing EDF (errors, defects and failures `don't use this short form in exam`) might take a long time.
> - Increase in time might lead to increase in the cost of the product (because developers need to be paid for the time they spend developing the product.)
> - EDF might cause the software to produce unintended or unexpected results.
> - Product might fail to deliver what it was meant to deliver.

- Total Quality Management (TQM):
> - A Management process that make sure all work and process to build the software aims towards the common goal of improving the overall quality or service or the product.
> - It is a continuous process of testing, quality assurance, supply chain management to improve the customer experience.
> - It aims to hold all parties involved in building the product accountable for the overall quality of the final product.
> - TQM is applicable to all aspects of the organization i.e. all business processes.

- Quality Practices of TQM:
> - Continuous improvement process (CIP): The main aim is to continuously work and improve the overall quality of the product at every stage from start to finish.
> - Zero Defects: The product or service  should not have any defects meaning the product should be of the most superior quality.
> - Six Sigma:
>   - TQM follows Six Sigma Method/principle
>   - Six Sigma Method is a method of calculating measurable improvements or defects in a product.
> - PDCA cycle:
>   - TQM follows PDCA cycle.
>   - PDCA stands for plan-do-check-act.

- Quality Control:
> - A process by which services/products are measured and tested to ensure that the quality of a product is maintained and improved against a set of benchmark so that any error that occurs can be either eliminated or reduced is known as quality control.

- Quality Management through - statistical process control
> - Statistical process control(SPC) is a quality control method that uses statistical techniques to monitor and control processes.
> - We can track the process and progress of products in real-time using SPC making SPC a good technique that facilitates real-time tracking.

- Quality Management through - cultural changes:
> - The method of managing, building and improving quality of the product by making required cultural changes in the organization is known as quality management method through cultural changes.

- Continual Improvement cycle:
> - The method of quality improvement that makes use of an iterative four-step management cycle known as PDCA cycle is known as continual improvement cycle method.
> - The term PDCA stands for Plan, Do, Check, Act.
> - PDCA is usually used in TQM.

> - Plan: Recognize an opportunity and define steps to reach the expected outcomes in quantifiable terms and plan actions for deviations.
> - Do: Execute the plan to achieve decided outcomes in small-scale.
> - Check: Check the outcomes to make sure they are correct.
> - Act: Apply the change on a large scale. Compare the planned and actual outcomes and if the change fails modify the plan.

- Benchmarking:
> - Comparing various quantitative and qualitative variables of a specific process/method against variables of another methods that are widely considered to be an industry standard or best Practices are known as benchmarking.
> - The variables can be - cost, time, defect count, satisfaction level, functionalities, etc.

>   - Testing
>   - Deployment and maintenance.

- Types of products:
> - Two types:
>   - Generic : Software products which were developed with the target to sell them to customer eligible to buy with no customization for any specific customer are called generic software products. These software products are stand-alone, can be up-gradable to new versions or updates while the updates are prepared by the software company or vendor who developed the product.
>   - Customized: Software products which were developed as per the requirements of a specific customer. Customized software products means a piece of software customized in case of features, workflow, design, language etc. or with additional features included or removed features and financed by a customer as the development cost or price of the software being developed.

- Software Development Life Cycle Models:
> - Waterfall model: One sdlc phase at a time.
> - Incremental model: Building model in parts and adding capabilities in a series of increments.
> - Spiral model: More details are added with each loop or iteration.
> - etc.

- Historical perspectives

`^ I don't think it would be that important but will do later if time permits`

- Definition:
> `Software Quality Assurance`
> - SQA is a process which guarantees that all software engineering progressions, methods, activities and work items are examined and comply contradiction of the defined standards.
>
> `Software Quality`
> - Software Quality means how well the software is designed and how well the software conforms to that design.
>

- Core components of Quality:
> - Customer Satisfaction
> - Quality Parameters
>   - Define: Defining product requirements in terms of attributes.
>   - Measure: Measuring quality in quantitative terms.
>   - Monitor: Observing performance of processes used in development, testing, and delivery.
>   - Control: Must have functions like quality control, validation, verification, and quality assurance. Product progress must be reviewed and controlled through these functions.
>   - Improve: Continuous and continual improvement methods should be followed by the organization.
> - Efforts for improvement
> - Continual / Continuous Process Improvement

- Continuous and Continual Improvement difference:

> Continuous Improvement | Continual Improvement
> ---|---
> Continuous Improvement is dynamic in nature | Continual improvement is dynamic and static change in management
> The changes are done at every stage and everytime | The changes are done before taking next step of improvement
> It Continuously strive for excellence | It performs periodic improvement followed by stabilization process.

- Customer, Suppliers and processes:
> - For every organization, there always exists someone who supplies and someone who buys the resources, the one who provides are known as suppliers where the one who is being provided is known as the customer.
> - Suppliers and Customers both maybe inside or outside of the organization.

- Objectives of Testing:
> - Prevent Defects
> - Evaluate work products
> - Verify requirements
> - Validate test objects
> - Build confidence
> - Reduce Risk
> - Share information to stakeholders
> - Find failures and defects

- Testing and Debugging:
> - Testing:
>   - Testing is the process of verifying and validating that a software or application is bug free, meets the technical requirements as guided by its design and development, and meets the user requirements effectively and efficiently by handling all the exceptions and boundary cases.
>
> - Debugging:
>   - Debugging is the process of fixing bugs. It can be defined as identifying, analyzing and removing bugs.
>   - This activity begins when the software fails to execute properly and ends with solving the problem underlying.

- Need of testing:
> - Because testing helps in:
>   - Identification and removal of errors.
>   - checking software adaptability.
>   - avoiding risks
>   - avoiding extra costs
>   - accelerate fault free software development.
>   - achieving and assuring high quality product

- Quality Assurance and Testing:

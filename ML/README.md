- Introduction to Machine Learning
> - The branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the study of algorithms and programs that help machines learn something automatically to result in better performance for a set of task over time is called as Machine Learning.

- Comparison of Machine Learning with traditional programming
- ML vs AI vs Data Science
`^ Will do later! Not having enough time to do trivial things`

- Types of Learning:
> - There are 4 types:
>   - Supervised
>   - Semi Supervised
>   - Unsupervised and
>   - Reinforcement

- Supervised Learning:
> - Supervised Learning is kind of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labelled data (i.e. the training dataset having both input and output) to build a mathematical model.
> - Supervised learning is usually used for classification or predicting a particular value. (regression)
> - Example: Classifying if the given picture is of a cat or a dog.
> - Common Algorithms:
>   - Logistic Regression
>   - Naïve Bayes
>   - k-NN
>   - Linear Regression

- Semi Supervised Learning:
> - Semi Supervised Learning is a kind of machine learning technique that makes use of both labelled as well as unlabeled training dataset when learning a model.
> - It falls between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning hence it is a special instance of weak supervision.

- Unsupervised Learning:
> - Unsupervised Learning is a kind of machine learning technique that learns pattern by creating clusters in the data from unlabeled training dataset (i.e. training dataset that only contains input data.)
> - For example, given a dataset with pictures of cat and dog without labels, Unsupervised learning algorithm will generate two unnamed clusters that contains cat and dog data.
> - Unsupervised Learning algorithms are used to find patterns in the data and build recommendation engine.

- Reinforcement Learning:
> - Reinforcement learning are kind of machine learning algorithm which improves upon themselves and learn from new situations using a trial-and-error method.
> - In Reinforcement learning, favorable outputs are encouraged i.e. "reinforced" whereas unfavorable outputs are discouraged.

- Models of Machine Learning:
> - Geometric Models
> - Probabilistic Models
> - Logical Models
> - Grouping and grading models
> - Parametric and non-parametric models

- Geometric Models:
> - Model based on Geometric principles comes under Geometric Models.
> - In Geometric models, features could be described as points in two or three dimensional space i.e (x, y) or (x, y, z) axis respectively.
> - If the data isn't geometric, it can be modelled in a geometric manner considering it geometric for example: temperature as a function of time.
> - Example: Linear regression, etc.
> - There are two types of geometric models:
>   - Linear models : Geometric concepts like planes, line etc.
>   - Distance based models : Geometric notion of distance to represent similarity.

- Probabilistic Models:
> - Models based on the idea of probability to predict new entities are known as Probabilistic Models.
> - Probabilistic models incorporate random variables and probability distributions into the model of an event or phenomenon.
> - A Probabilistic model gives a probability distribution as a solution.

- Logical Models:
> - Model that uses logical expression to divide the instance space into segments is called as logical models.
> - Logical expressions are expressions that returns boolean true and false after evaluation.
> - Once the data is grouped using a logical expression, the data is divided into homogeneous groupings for the problem we are trying to solve.
> - There are two types of logical models:
>   - Rule models : Use a collection of `if-then` statements
>   - Tree models : `If` part of the rules are organized in a tree structure.
>   - ^ Both uses same approach to Supervised Learning

- Grouping Models:
> - Model that breaks the instance space into groups or segments is called as the grouping model.
> - The number of groups is determined at the training time.

- Grading Models:
> - Model that form one global model over the instance space is known as grading model.

- Parametric Models:
> - Models that requires a fixed number of parameters to build the model is called as parametric models.

- Non-parametric Models:
> - Models that does not require any specific parameter setting is known as non-parametric model.

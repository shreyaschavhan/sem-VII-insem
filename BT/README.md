- Cryptography:
> - The field of study that deals with the study of secure communication techniques which allows only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.

- Symmetric Cryptography:
> - Kind of Cryptography where encryption key is same as the decryption key.
> - Also known as secret key Cryptography or shared key Cryptography or private key cryptography.
> - Key needs to be established before any communication begins.
> - Types:
>   - Stream Cipher
>     - Applies the encryption algorithms one bit at a time.
>   - Block cyphers
>     - Applies the encryption algorithm block by block after dividing the plain text into blocks of a predefined size.
>     - Example: DES and AES i.e. Data Encryption Standard & Advanced Encryption Standard.

- Asymmetric Cryptography:
> - Kind of cryptography where encryption key is distinct from the decryption key.
> - Another name is public key cryptography.
> - It uses both public as well as private keys.
> - Example: RSA, DSA, and ElGammal.
> - They are slower as compared to symmetric key algorithm in terms of computation and hence isn't used for large sized data.

- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
> - Collection of points that satisfies a specific mathematical equation is known as Elliptic curve cryptography.
> - Elliptic curve equation look something like this:
>   - `y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`
> -

- Centralized Systems:
> - Centralized systems are the systems that works on client-server system architecture in which a central authority has every rights and is incharge of the system.
> - For example, you are messaging someone on facebook. Facebook is the one that verifies the message is valid, and then delivers the message to the user.

- Advantage of Centralized system:
> - Reduced cost
> - Quick decision implementation.
> - Command chain.

- Limitation of Centralized system:
> - Security
> - Trust
> - Privacy
> - Single point of failure
> - Scalable limitation
> - Inflexibility
> - Access and diversity

- Decentralized System:
> - They are the systems where each node is master of it's own, i.e. there doesn't exist any master node for nodes in the system.
> - Blockchain Technology made decentralization possible.

- Advantages of Decentralization:
> - Provides a trustless environment.
> - improves data reconciliation
> - Reduces points of weakness
> - Optimizes resource distribution.

- Layers of blockchain:
> - Application Layer : The user can code desired functionality and build the application.
> - Execution Layer : It operates the execution of all the instructions that were defined in application layer.
> - Semantic Layer: This layer is used for the validation of blocks created in the network and also validating the transactions performed in the blockchain.
> - Propagation Layer: It handles the peer-to-peer communications between the network nodes.
> - Consensus layer: The main aim of this layer is to make sure that all the nodes must agree on a common state of the shared ledger, the layer also works on the security and safety of the blockchain.


- Why blockchain is important?
> - Blockchain and it's use is important because of following properties and functionality that it provides:
>   - Security: Blockchain being trustless protocol and it having decentralized nature makes blockchain very secure.
>   - Transparency: Every change, every detail and everything is very transparent as everything is visible to all the participants in consideration.
>   - Time of transaction is less.
>   - It increases efficiency in finance.
>   - Scope of Innovation: there exists a massive scope for innovation in BT.
>   - No middleman in the transactions
>   - Blockchain has numerous application in various technological fields.
>   - Ease of traceability.


- Blockchain Adoption So Far:
> - Following industries have started adopting blockchain technology.
>   - Automotive
>   - Banking and Financial services
>   - Government
>   - Healthcare and life sciences
>   - Supply chain
>   - Insurance
>   - Media and entertainment
>   - Retail and consumer good
>   - Telecommunication
>   - Travel and transport
>   - etc.

- Cryptography:
> - The field of study that deals with the study of secure communication techniques which allows only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents.

- Symmetric Cryptography:
> - Kind of Cryptography where encryption key is same as the decryption key.
> - Also known as secret key Cryptography or shared key Cryptography or private key cryptography.
> - Key needs to be established before any communication begins.
> - Types:
>   - Stream Cipher
>     - Applies the encryption algorithms one bit at a time.
>   - Block cyphers
>     - Applies the encryption algorithm block by block after dividing the plain text into blocks of a predefined size.
>     - Example: DES and AES i.e. Data Encryption Standard & Advanced Encryption Standard.

- Asymmetric Cryptography:
> - Kind of cryptography where encryption key is distinct from the decryption key.
> - Another name is public key cryptography.
> - It uses both public as well as private keys.
> - Example: RSA, DSA, and ElGammal.
> - They are slower as compared to symmetric key algorithm in terms of computation and hence isn't used for large sized data.

- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC):
> - Collection of points that satisfies a specific mathematical equation is known as Elliptic curve cryptography.
> - Elliptic curve equation look something like this:
>   - `y^2 = x^3 + ax + b`
> -

> - Application Layer
> - Execution Layer
> - Semantic Layer
> - Propagation Layer
> - Consensus layer


- Why blockchain is important?
> - Blockchain and it's use is important because of following properties and functionality that it provides:
>   - Security: Blockchain being trustless protocol and it having decentralized nature makes blockchain very secure.
>   - Transparency: Every change, every detail and everything is very transparent as everything is visible to all the participants in consideration.
>   - Time of transaction is less.
>   - It increases efficiency in finance.
>   - Scope of Innovation: there exists a massive scope for innovation in BT.
>   - No middleman in the transactions
>   - Blockchain has numerous application in various technological fields.
>   - Ease of traceability.


- Blockchain Adoption So Far:
> - Following industries have started adopting blockchain technology.
>   - Automotive
>   - Banking and Financial services
>   - Government
>   - Healthcare and life sciences
>   - Supply chain
>   - Insurance
>   - Media and entertainment
>   - Retail and consumer good
>   - Telecommunication
>   - Travel and transport
>   - etc.

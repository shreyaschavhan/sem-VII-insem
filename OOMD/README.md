- What is Object Orientation?
> - Organization of software as a collection of discrete/distinct objects that incorporate both data structure and behavior.
> - There are 4 aspects of OO:
>   - Identity: Means data is arranged in distinguished entities called objects.
>   - Classification: It's a technique in which objects with same data structure (attribute) and behavior(operations) are grouped into class.
>   - Inheritance: Allowing the class to share properties of another class in hierarchical manner.
>   - Polymorphism: Same operation can be defined differently for the different classes.

- Advanced objects and class concept:
> - Advanced class are special types of classes that can be used to be represented in UML diagram. These are:
>   - Enumeration
>   - Multiplicity
>   - Scope
>   - Visibility
> - Enumeration: Enumeration is a primitive data type which can have a finite set of values and can be modelled as classes.
> - Multiplicity: Multiplicity denotes how many objects can be associated with particular object.
> - Scope: Scope represents whether a feature is available for a class or not.
>   - There are 2 types of scope in UML:
>     - Static scope
>     - Object/Instance scope
> - Visibility: It represents how the attributes and operations are visible in the system.
>   - There are 4 levels of Visibility:
>     - public
>     - protected
>     - private
>     - package


- Association ends:
> - Endpoints of association relationship is called as association ends.

- n-ary Association:
> - Association is a structural relationship between two classes.
> - It can be shown by drawing a solid line between two classes.
> - Association between two classes are called binary.
> - Association between three classes are called ternary.
> - Association between three or more classes are called n-ary association.

- Aggregation:
> - Aggregation is a type of Association
> - It is used to represent whole-part relationship.
> - It normally posses has-a relationship
> - For example: car has a dvd player

- Abstract classes:
> - Abstract classes are those classes which do not have any direct instances.
> - When generalization is modelled, the abstract classes are at the top level and other classes are at the bottom.

- Concrete classes:
> - Concrete classes are those classes who have direct instance.

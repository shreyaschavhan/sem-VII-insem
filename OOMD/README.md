- What is Object Orientation?
> - Organization of software as a collection of discrete/distinct objects that incorporate both data structure and behavior.
> - There are 4 aspects of OO:
>   - Identity: Means data is arranged in distinguished entities called objects.
>   - Classification: It's a technique in which objects with same data structure (attribute) and behavior(operations) are grouped into class.
>   - Inheritance: Allowing the class to share properties of another class in hierarchical manner.
>   - Polymorphism: Same operation can be defined differently for the different classes.
